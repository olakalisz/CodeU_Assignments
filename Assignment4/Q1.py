"""The approach taken in this solution is based on DFS search and is very similar to searching for connecting
   components of the graph. We visit every tile of the given map grid and if the land tile is found we
   perform a DFS search from it (with 'edges' between every two adjacent land tiles) to find the whole island.
   Once DFS search is finished the island counter is incremented. Every visited tile is marked as visited so
   we visit each tile just once. The running time of the given solution is Î¸(NXM), where N is the number of rows
   in a map grid and M is the number of columns."""
