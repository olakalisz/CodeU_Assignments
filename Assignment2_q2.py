"""Finds the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in the given tree. Uses two methods:
   first one to 'get_ancestors_recursive' to find the ancestors of each of two nodes and
   second 'lowest_common_ancestor' to compare the ancestors of two nodes and find the lowest
   common one.
   Given solution takes Î¸(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree."""
