"""Prints all the ancestors of the key in the given binary tree. Uses two methods:
   first method 'print_ancestors' takes a tree and a key and calls the second helper
   recursive method 'get_ancestors_recursive' which also takes tree and a key but it
   also passes a list of ancestors so far as an argument.
   Given solution takes Î¸(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree."""
