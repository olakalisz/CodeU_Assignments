them) and M is the number of dictionary words. There are two main steps performed in the given solution. First is to
create a graph corresponding to the partial (lexicographical) order of characters in dictionary words. Second step
creates a total order of characters (i. e. the lexicographical order or in other words ordered alphabet) which are
stored at first in a singly linked list and then copied to the list of characters, This step uses a topological sort
