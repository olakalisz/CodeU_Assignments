"""The approach taken in this solution is based on a DFS-like search. The worst case running time
   is Î¸((NXM)^2) (where N is the number of rows and M number of columns in the given gird)but because of the optimization
   used with isPrefix(string) method the average running time should be a lot better.
   The solution given below performs the DFS-like search on the given grid (using words_search_recursive method)
   but it searches ALL possible paths from each entry in a grid (corresponding to a letter).
   This is similar to creating a big search tree with all possible words. Using isPrefix(string) method
   it 'cuts off' early all the branches of the search tree which is being created that cannot form words."""
